# Nguyen_Lai_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Phase 1
Our project will be creating a TicTacToe game where players can play against one another. 

Phase 2
To succesfully run the program, download the main.cpp, TicTacToe.cpp, and TicTacToe.h files. 
Once that is done, create a project with the class files TicTacToe.h and TicTacToe.cpp. Copy and paste the downloaded files into the project and compile. 
After that, you should be able to run the program and play against a friend. 

This program will run on the VirtualMachine

No known bugs yet.

Whoever is reviewing this, if there is a data structure that you believe you can add feel free to, as the program only has arrays and not really in depth data structure code.
